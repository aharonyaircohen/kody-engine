 *   AGENTS.md  — Cross-tool fallback used by Aider/Cursor/Codex/etc.
 *                Loaded so kody2 also works on repos that follow the
 *                broader industry convention rather than Claude's own.
 *
 * Both are loaded if present, in the order above (CLAUDE.md first so it's
 * the prompt's primary authority). The Claude Code SDK auto-loads
 * ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and ~/.claude/rules but does NOT reliably auto-load
 * project-root CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, so we read them ourselves.

# Quality gates (MUST all pass)
${qualityLines.join("\n")}

# Required steps (all in this one session — no handoff)
1. **Research** — read the issue carefully. Use Grep/Glob/Read to investigate the codebase: locate relevant files, understand existing patterns, check related tests, identify constraints. Do not edit anything yet.
2. **Plan** — before any Edit/Write, output a short plan (5–10 lines): what files you'll change, the approach, what could go wrong. No fluff.
3. **Build** — Edit/Write to implement the change. Stay within the plan; if you discover the plan was wrong, briefly say so and adjust.
4. **Verify** — run each quality command with Bash. On failure, fix the root cause and re-run. When reporting that a command passed, you MUST have just run it and seen exit code 0 in this session — do not paraphrase prior output.
5. Your FINAL message must use this exact format (or a single \`FAILED: <reason>\` line on failure):

   \`\`\`
   DONE
   COMMIT_MSG: <conventional-commit message, e.g. "feat: add X" or "fix: handle Y">
   PR_SUMMARY:
   <2-6 short bullet points or sentences describing what you actually changed, why, and how the new code works at a high level. Reviewers will read THIS — not the issue body — to understand the change. Be concrete: name the files/functions/endpoints you added or modified. No marketing fluff. No restating the issue.>
   \`\`\`

# Rules
- Do NOT run **any** \`git\` or \`gh\` commands. Not for committing. Not for pushing. Not for inspecting state. Not for "verifying whether failures are pre-existing." Not stash, checkout, diff, status, log, branch — none. The wrapper handles all git/gh operations. If a quality gate fails, that's the failure — do not investigate it via git.
- Stay on the current branch (\`${featureBranch}\`). It is already checked out for you.
- Do NOT modify files under: \`.kody/\`, \`.kody-engine/\`, \`.kody-lean/\`, \`node_modules/\`, \`dist/\`, \`build/\`, \`.env\`, or any \`*.log\`.
- Do NOT post issue comments — the wrapper handles that.
- Pre-existing quality-gate failures: assume they are NOT your responsibility unless your edits touched related code. If quality gates are red but your edits are unrelated, output \`DONE\` with a COMMIT_MSG describing only what you actually changed.
- Keep the plan and reasoning concise. Long monologues waste turns.`
